0.03    Wed Oct 03 23:00:00 EDT 2007
        - improved documentation and included serialization example
        - error() renamed to errstr()
        - errstr() now supports class-based errors
        - removed archname() method
        - removed osname() method
        - removed osvers() method
        - repurposed config() method
        - config determination now occurs automatically at the constructor
        - local configuration is no longer represented as the output from
          Config::myconfig() - each major config is split out and distinct
        - constructor now sets errstr and returns undef on failure
        - RFC 2822 compliance regex no longer assembled on a per-object basis
        - validate() added - ensures from/grade/dist are valid
        - many more tests added - over 97% test coverage now! =)

0.02    Wed Sep 26 02:30:00 EDT 2007
        - Quadrupled the number of tests
        - Removed maturity() from the API
        - Changed interpreter_vers1 to interpreter_vers_numeric
        - Changed interpreter_vers2 to interpreter_vers_float
        - via() is now automatically calculated based on the caller
        - via() also now includes itself (C::T::R)
        - from(), if specified, must be RFC 2822 compliant
        - We now reject attempts to report on perl itself, as opposed to a
          CPAN distribution (use perlbug!)
        - Notated the dependency on Time::Local in Makefile.PL
        - Corrected an initialization defect with osname()
        - Plenty of brain-storming in the TODO section of the POD
        - Started work on the new/separate transport distributions. This should
          help solidify and validate the API of C::T::R
        - In addition to the constructor already automatically populating the
          datetime, it now automatically calculates via() and the RFC 2822
          compliance regex (see TODO though)

0.01    Tue Sep 25 02:30:00 EDT 2007
